**Summary of Home Sales Data Analysis**

1. **Data Import and Setup:**
   - The home sales data from the provided CSV file was loaded into a Spark DataFrame and a temporary table named `home_sales` was created.

2. **Average Price Analysis:**
   - **Four-Bedroom Houses:** The average price for four-bedroom houses sold each year was calculated, rounded to two decimal places.
   - **Three-Bedroom, Three-Bathroom Homes:** The average price of homes, built each year with three bedrooms and three bathrooms, was determined and rounded to two decimal places.
   - **Detailed Criteria:** Further analysis was conducted on homes built each year with three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and a size greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet. The average price was computed and rounded to two decimal places.

3. **Average Price per "View" Rating:**
   - The average price of homes per "view" rating, having an average price greater than or equal to $350,000, was investigated. The runtime for this query was determined to be approximately 1.83 seconds.

4. **Caching and Performance Comparison:**
   - The `home_sales` temporary table was cached to improve query performance. The caching status was verified.
   - The query calculating the average price per "view" rating was rerun using the cached data. The runtime was approximately 2.61 seconds, indicating a slight increase compared to the uncached runtime.

5. **Data Partitioning and Analysis:**
   - The home sales data was partitioned by the `date_built` field and stored in Parquet format.
   - A temporary table for the Parquet data was created and used to run the previous query. The runtime was approximately 1.03 seconds, demonstrating improved performance compared to the uncached runtime.

6. **Cache Removal:**
   - The `home_sales` temporary table was uncached, and its caching status was verified.

The analysis provided valuable insights into the home sales data, including average prices based on various criteria and the impact of caching on query performance.
